# Fast Mobile Assignment

Hi! On this repository you can find the assignment solved. I used a VIP architecture and created the following modules:
- Results
- Favorites

The remaining files on such file group are simple view controllers that do not follow the architecture mentioned above, simply because there was no need to. 

On the following [link](https://wetransfer.com/downloads/ba4fca2b0806cc630f3515dc4dfc7d3e20210302004157/9b325db4535983fd838c3f042e0fdffe20210302004157/fe6563) you can donwload a video I made as evidence of the application working.



# Summary Questions

1. I feel the most difficult part was creating a network layer without using Alamofire. Truth to be told, I've been using it for a long time and never tried creating network requests without it. Nevertheless, I can mention not long ago, on the project I'm working on, we had to upgrade the library and the transition was not easy at all.
2. I feel the previous question answers this question. In addition to that, I can say that I learned a little bit about generics, which I included on the Api Client.
3. I believe I included all the requirements stated on the PDF. Now, regarding what took me the majority of the time, I'd say the network layer, meaning creating the ApiClient, creating generic requests, and using the decodable protocol on the response.
4. I think this application can be improved by saving the movies the user has marked as favorite. This can be done either by persisting this info on the device or by adding an api endpoint which would store the data. The second approach would require the user to log in the application though.    
5. (Bonus question) I wished I could've done the project using SwiftUI, but the reality is that I've never worked with it, and it would've taken me way more than 5 hours to finish this project.
